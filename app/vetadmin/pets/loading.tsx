// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the loading.tsx file contains code that uses variables named "brevity", "it", "is", "correct", and "and" without declaring or importing them.
// To fix this, I will declare these variables with a default value of null at the top of the file.
// This is a placeholder solution, and the actual fix might involve importing these variables from another module or initializing them with appropriate values based on their intended use.
